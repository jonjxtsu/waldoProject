# waldoProject
AWS model training results. <br/>
Our project involves using AWS Sagemaker to train a model that could detect Waldo. <br/>
We use "Amazon SageMaker Object Detection using the Image and JSON format" provided by AWS - Labs as a template to train the model.<br/>
The results of a number of trained models are provided in this repository.<br/>
The project was fun and provided much insight in regards to machine learning, object detection, and use of AWS.<br/><br/>
